Meteoblue predicts temperatures of around 6.6\u00b0C\u20132.2\u00b0C, which is 2.1\u20131.2\u00b0C higher than the baseline. Meteoblue does not provide information on rainfall or sunshine duration. With slightly warmer temperatures, it could be a good day for a walk, just keep an eye out for any rogue bumblebees enjoying the warmth.",
