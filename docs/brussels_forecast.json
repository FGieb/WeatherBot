Meteoblue indicates a higher temperature range with a high of 5.6\u00b0C (42\u00b0F) and a low of 3.3\u00b0C (38\u00b0F), compared to the baseline's 4\u00b0C/1\u00b0C. No other deviations or data from other sources. Seems like a typical winter day in Brussels, just a bit chillier than the baseline predicted.",
