  "gpt_comment": "Based on the available data, it appears that there is a slight discrepancy between the original forecast summary and the scraped forecast from Meteoblue. While the original forecast suggests an average temperature of 23.1\u00b0C, Meteoblue indicates a temperature range between approximately 13.3\u00b0C (56\u00b0F) and 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). There seems to be a significant difference in the lower temperature, though this could potentially be explained by different times of day. As for the other sources, YR.no did not provide any data and KNMI does not cover Brussels, therefore we cannot use them for comparison. Given these considerations, while there is some divergence, the upper range of the temperature forecast aligns closely enough that we should still maintain a level of confidence in the original forecast. However, the discrepancy in the lower temperatures should be noted and taken into account."
