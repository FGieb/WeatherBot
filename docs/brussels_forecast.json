Meteoblue indicates a high of 14.4\u00b0C (58\u00b0F) and low of 9.4\u00b0C (49\u00b0F), which is materially higher than the baseline's 10\u00b0C high and 8\u00b0C low. Rain data and wind speed from Meteoblue were not stated. With the warmer weather, it seems like a perfect day for a walk in Brussels, just don't forget a light jacket in case of unforecasted rain.",
