Meteoblue forecasts a temperature of around 13.3\u00b0C (56\u00b0F), slightly higher than the baseline's average of 12.2\u00b0C. Rainfall is not explicitly stated by Meteoblue. The lack of data from other sources adds to the uncertainty of the forecast. This might just be one of those days where you feel like a donkey, not knowing whether to carry an umbrella or not.",
