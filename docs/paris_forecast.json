Meteoblue also confirms these temperatures, though in Fahrenheit, predicting a high of 85\u00b0F (approx 29.4\u00b0C) and a low of 66\u00b0F (approx 18.9\u00b0C). Perfect weather for those who enjoy basking in the sun, perhaps it's a day to see the city from a different perspective, like our simian friends at the zoo!",
