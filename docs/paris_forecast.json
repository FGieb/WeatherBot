  "gpt_comment": "Well, Meteoblue's giving us a bit of a Fahrenheit curveball, but if we convert those to Celsius we get a high of about 29\u00b0C and a low of 18\u00b0C. That's a smidge cooler than OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI's predictions. No word on rain from Meteoblue, but with no one else on the team able to pitch in, we're just gonna have to trust our original forecast. So pack your sunglasses and enjoy a sunny day in Paris, but maybe take a light cardigan just in case!"
